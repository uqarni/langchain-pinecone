# langchain-pinecone
experiment with langchain and pinecone

# how it works
ingest a PDF
langchain breaks it up into documents
openai changes these into embeddings - literally a list of numbers. a giant vector in 1500-dimensional space
pinecone stores these embeddings externally

openai turns a question into an embedding; pinecone will return the embeddings most similar to that query
openai will take those supplied embeddings and return an answer

# to get detectron2 (doesnt work still)
apt-get update && apt-get -y install pybind11-dev
CC=clang CXX=clang++ ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git' --user

# pinecone
remember, openai embeddings have 1536 dimensions
